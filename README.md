# AirSimNeurIPS API Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies to run the AirSimNeurIPS API and simulations.

To get started, clone this repository to your directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/robin6205/SWARM-Drone-Racer.git
```

## 1. Check Python Version

Before proceeding, ensure that you have Python version > 3.6 installed on your system (python 3.10 is supported). You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

Make sure the output shows Python 3.10. If you do not have Python 3.10 installed, you will need to install it before proceeding.

## 2. *Optional: Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated. To create and activate a virtual environment, use the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv airsimvenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\airsimvenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Linux/MacOS**:
  ```bash
  source airsimvenv/bin/activate
  ```

## 3. Install Python Packages from `requirements.txt`

With the virtual environment activated (if you created one), install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 4. Prepare to Run the Simulation

Download the v0.3 [Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing/releases/tag/v0.3.0-linux) or [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing/releases/tag/v0.3.0) AirSim.zip, and unzip it.

Download the training environments (shipped in pakfiles):
- **Soccer_Field.pak**

Move the environment pakfiles into `AirSim/AirSimExe/Content/Paks`.

Download and move the `settings.json` file to `~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json` (Mac/Linux/Windows).

Now that your environment is set up, you are ready to run the AirSimNeurIPS API. Execute the simulation by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory and running the following command:

```bash
./AirsimExe.exe -windowed
```

This will start the simulation in a windowed mode.

## 5. Run Your Script

Finally, you can run your Python script to interact with the simulation. Replace `flighttest.py` with the name of your script:

```bash
python flighttest.py
```

Your setup is complete, and you are now ready to run your simulations with the AirSimNeurIPS API.
